Dragon Knight
Changelog

Dragon Knight 1.1.12  (06.29.2017) by Kesstryl
All changes to vanilla code were done to increase security and make code php5 compatible.
Security changes are only bare minimum, add your own to increase security, or use at your own risk.
php5 code upgrades
- changed database type from MyIsam to InnoDB in install.php
- Changed mysql to mysqli for all database commands throughout code.
- defined variables wherever they were undefined.
Security changes
- changed cookies to use a hash code which is changed at every login.
- set cookies to http only.
- added htaccess files in all folders to prevent directory snooping.
- added a function to check for host url to protect against csfr wherever POST and GET are used. This will throw an error if logged in through cookies and not the login form, but the error goes away once you do something.
- added a token hidden field in POST forms in admin panel to protect against csfr.
- changed admin.php to go back to the index page if unauthorized to use the admin panel.
- changed hash algorithm for passwords from md5 to sha256.
- added a salt to passwords.
- added a string sanitize function and implemented it wherever there is POST data.
- added an array sanitize function and implemented it wherever there is GET data.
- added an array sanitize function and implemented it where POST data is extracted as an array.
- EXTR_SKIP has been added to the extract global as an extra security measure.
- libxml_disable_entity_loader set to true in the xml variable to prevent xml entity expansion attacks. 
- added a hidden field in registration to prevent spam registration.
Additional changes
- added the top ten mod created by renderse7en from the DK mods forums because he created this engine and also wrote the mod.
